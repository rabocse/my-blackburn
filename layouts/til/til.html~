  <h1> TIL - Today I Learned </h1>
</div>

<div class="content">


	<h2>What You (and I) will find here? </h2>

	<li> Things I learn in a daily basis and I think (for some reason) are worth to write (don't ask me why!).</li>

	<li> Things I "know" but I tend to "forget".</li>

	<li> Things that perhaps initially do not require the full dedication and editing of a blog post. </li>


	<h2>Why this section?</h2>

- Another effort at public learning.

- Have you noticed... how much you pontentially learn (or at least you get familiar with) any time you "go down the rabbit hole" at "certain" topic or problem? 

- Writing a "full post" is not that straighforward for me. Assuming I have the a topic or idea to write about, the sanitizing, editing, etc etc. it just takes time! Here it will be more spontanoeus. 

- Why to go to Google, if I know I have my answer here? 


	<h2>Inspired By?</h2>

- I would like to say I came with this idea but... no!, I believe Josh was the one: https://github.com/jbranchaud/til.
